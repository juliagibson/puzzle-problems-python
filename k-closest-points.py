# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).
# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).
#
# Example 1: 
# Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
# Output: [[-2,2]]
#
# Example 2:
# Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
# Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
